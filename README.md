# FaceDetectionFromScratch

The idea is to generate inception network from scratch and then load pre-trained coefficients, because to train a FaceNet model takes a lot of data. There are two Kivy simple applications to use this trained model. First app helps to generate database of faces and the second one returns the live result of the model.
